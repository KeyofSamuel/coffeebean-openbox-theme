# README for Coffeebean Openbox Theme

## About

This is an Openbox theme created with no real specific design scope outside of colors and options that I find aesthetically pleasing for my personal worksktations.  I hope to release more configuration options that I use on my Openbox desktop running Arch Linux.  For now, this is a good start.  This repository holds the theme configurations and .xbm files.  If you are interested in a complete PKGBUILD file for Arch Linux, email me.  I may eventually put this up on the AUR.

## Version

Version: **0.5**

## Manual Installation

Copy the _Coffeebean_ folder into /usr/share/themes/. 

## Please Be Kind

This is the first theme I've created, as well as my first attempt at creating an Arch package.  This is definitely still in rough _beta_ shape.  Hopefully over time I'll smooth the rough edges.
